    title: 'Using BPF to Transform SSH Sessions into Structured Events',
    description: `Teleport 4.2 introduced a new feature called Enhanced Session Recording that takes an unstructured SSH session and outputs a stream of structured events. It’s the next step in Teleport’s evolution that uses new technology (eBPF or now simply known as BPF) to close some gaps in Teleport’s audit abilities. Below you can see an illustration of this feature and if you keep reading, we’ll get into some of the technical details.`,

    description:
      'In the wake of the US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and the retaliatory missile strike that followed, Iran-watchers have warned that the country could deploy cyberattacks as well, perhaps even targeting US critical infrastructure like the electric grid.

But they’ve been working to gain access to American electric utilities, long before tensions between the two countries came to a head.',

    description:
      "Ford CEO Jim Hackett scaled back hopes about the company's plans for self-driving cars this week, admitting that the first vehicles will have limits. 'We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,' said Hackett, who once headed the company's autonomous vehicle division, at a Detroit Economic Club event on Tuesday. While Ford still plans on launching its self-driving car fleet in 2021, Hackett added that 'its applications will be narrow, what we call geo-fenced, because the problem is so complex'.",
